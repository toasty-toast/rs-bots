## Runescape Bots For OSBot
This respository contains various bots intended for use in [Oldschool Runescape](http://oldschool.runescape.com/) through the [OSBot](http://osbot.org/) game client.

### Building & Installing
This project now uses Apache Ant to build the files.  Simply run `ant all` to build the bots and they will be in the dist directory.  If you do not have Ant or want to build it yourself, releases on Github should be coming soon.

### License
Code released under the MIT license, because copying and sharing code is a beautiful thing.
