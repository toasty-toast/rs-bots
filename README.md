## Runescape Bots For OSBot
This respository contains various bots intended for use in [Oldschool Runescape](http://oldschool.runescape.com/) through the [OSBot](http://osbot.org/) game client.

### Building & Installing
To build the bots in Windows, execute the file build.bat.  The jar files for OSBot to run will be created in the build directory.  To use the bots, move these files to the appropriate directory.  In Windows, this directory is `C:\Users\*YourUserName*\OSBot\Scripts` by default.  If you haven't changed this default directory you can simply execute install.bat and the bots will be ready to use immediately.
